#+title: Logic

- I get the data from the sav.
  - I impute it with mice and export it to simpler_rankings

- I import it in 02-make-freq-ranks-inferred.jl
  - I transform it from rankings to orderings
  - I calculate frequency and proportion of orderings
  - I save the rankings_vectors version as orderings_inferred
  - I save the 1-4 columns of choices as freq_ranks_inferred

- I import freq_ranks_inferred in 03-others_plus_transfer
  - I transfer and find 4 equivalence classes that minimize euclidean distance;
  - I export the raw and the corrected orderings (with frequency and proportion)
- I import that raw to corrected_indexes.jl
  - I export the INDEXES of the corrected orderings


- This then, goes to the plots in visualize_indexes.R
