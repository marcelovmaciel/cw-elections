#+title: Transfer Algorithm

- See who is undervoted: {b,h}
- See who is overvoted: {a,c}
- Place candidates on ideological ordering: (h,c,a,b)

- Select overvoted;
- Select closest undervoted;
- transfer votes from minimal kemeny distance to having overvoted as first;
- check if reached under-over voted parity
  - else transfer vote from second minimal kemeny distance;
- check if overvoting ended.
  - If not recur to kemeny minimizing subproc
  - If YES go to other overvoted and LOOP

- Save things:
  - save transferred df;
  - save proportions;
  - save proportion diff;
  - show transfer pareto frontier;

Actual voting tally proportions: bolsonaro:haddad:ciro:alckmin:other = 46.3:29.28:12.47:4.76:7.19

What I have: 36.7:24.7:17.3:14.1:7.19
