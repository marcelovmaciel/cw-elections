  abstract        = {Democracies require compromise. But compromise becomes
                  almost impossible when voters are divided into diametrically
                  opposed camps. The danger is that intolerance will grow,
                  democratic norms will be undermined, and winners will be
                  reluctant to let the losers ever regain power. To better
                  understand how polarization can be prevented, or at least
                  slowed, we developed a simple model in which people tend to be
                  exposed to and attracted by views similar to their own, but
                  are repulsed by views that are too dissimilar. The policy
                  implications are described in terms of level of tolerance to
                  other views, responsiveness to other views, exposure to
                  dissimilar views, multiple ideological dimensions, economic
                  self-interest, and external shocks.Extreme polarization can
                  undermine democracy by making compromise impossible and
                  transforming politics into a zero-sum game.

                  polarization{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}the extent to
                  which political views are widely dispersed{\textemdash}is
                  already strong among elites, but less so among the general
                  public [N. McCarty, Polarization: What Everyone Needs to Know,
                  2019, pp. 50{\textendash}68]. Strong mutual distrust and
                  hostility between Democrats and Republicans in the United
                  States, combined with the elites{\textquoteright} already
                  strong ideological polarization, could lead to increasing
                  ideological polarization among the public. The paper addresses
                  two questions: 1) Is there a level of ideological polarization
                  above which polarization feeds upon itself to become a runaway
                  process? 2) If so, what policy interventions could prevent
                  such dangerous positive feedback loops? To explore these
                  questions, we present an agent-based model of ideological
                  polarization that differentiates between the tendency for two
                  actors to interact
                  ({\textquotedblleft}exposure{\textquotedblright}) and how they
                  respond when interactions occur, positing that interaction
                  between similar actors reduces their difference, while
                  interaction between dissimilar actors increases their
                  difference. Our analysis explores the effects on polarization
                  of different levels of tolerance to other views,
                  responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar actors,
                  multiple ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and
                  external shocks. The results suggest strategies for
                  preventing, or at least slowing, the development of extreme
                  polarization.},

                  Dynamics of Political Polarization Special Feature.
                  Baldassarri reads the contribution of the papers in light of
                  the theoretical distinction between ideological partisanship,
                  which is generally rooted in sociodemographic and political
                  cleavages, and affective partisanship, which is, instead,
                  mostly fueled by emotional attachment and repulsion, rather
                  than ideology and material interests. The latter, she argues,
                  is likely to lead to a runaway process and threaten the
                  pluralistic bases of contemporary democracy. Page sees the
                  contribution of the many distinct models in the ensemble as
                  potentially contributing more than the parts. Individual
                  papers identify distinct causes of polarization as well as
                  potential solutions. Viewed collectively, the papers suggest
                  that the multiple causes of polarization may self-reinforce,
                  which suggests that successful interventions would require a
                  variety of efforts. Understanding how to construct such
                  interventions may require larger models with greater
                  realism.There are no data underlying this work.},

  abstract        = {In the Madisonian Constitution, fragmented and overlapping
                  institutions of authority are supposed to manage
                  democracy{\textquoteright}s innate rivalry, channeling
                  competition to serve the public interest. This system of
                  safeguards makes democracy more robust: capable of
                  withstanding and, if need be, adapting to challenges posed by
                  a changing problem environment. In this essay, I suggest why
                  affective polarization poses a special threat to democratic
                  robustness. While most scholars hypothesize that
                  polarization{\textquoteright}s dangers are that it leads to
                  bimodality and extremism, I highlight a third hypothesized
                  effect: Polarization reduces interest and information
                  diversity in the political system. To be effective,
                  democracy{\textquoteright}s safeguards rely upon interest
                  diversity, but Madison took that diversity for granted. Unique
                  among democracy{\textquoteright}s safeguards, federalism
                  builds in a repository for diversity; its structure enables
                  differences between national- and state-expressed interests,
                  even within the same party. This diversity can be democracy
                  hindering, as the United States{\textquoteright} history with
                  racially discriminatory politics painfully makes clear, but it
                  can also serve as a reservoir of interest and information
                  dispersion that could protect democracy by restoring the
                  possibility that cross-cutting cleavages emerge.},

                  article helps illuminate what drives it, as well as what
                  factors account for its asymmetric nature. In particular, we
                  focus on positive feedback among members of Congress as the
                  key mechanism of polarization. We show how public opinion,
                  which responds to the laws legislators make, in turn drives
                  the feedback dynamics of political elites. Specifically, we
                  find that voters{\textquoteright} {\textquotedblleft}policy
                  mood,{\textquotedblright} i.e., whether public opinion leans
                  in a more liberal or conservative direction, drives
                  asymmetries in elite polarization over time. Our model also
                  demonstrates that once self-reinforcing processes among elites
                  reach a critical threshold, polarization rapidly accelerates.
                  By tying together elite and voter dynamics, this paper
                  presents a unified theory of political polarization.Using a
                  general model of opinion dynamics, we conduct a systematic
                  investigation of key mechanisms driving elite polarization in
                  the United States. We demonstrate that the self-reinforcing
                  nature of elite-level processes can explain this polarization,
                  with voter preferences accounting for its asymmetric nature.
                  Our analysis suggests that subtle differences in the frequency
                  and amplitude with which public opinion shifts left and right
                  over time may have a differential effect on the
                  self-reinforcing processes of elites, causing Republicans to
                  polarize more quickly than Democrats. We find that as
                  self-reinforcement approaches a critical threshold,
                  polarization speeds up. Republicans appear to have crossed
                  that threshold while Democrats are currently approaching it.},

  abstract        = {Our study was motivated by a highly disturbing puzzle.
                  Confronted with a deadly global pandemic that threatened not
                  only massive loss of life but also the collapse of our medical
                  system and economy, why were we unable to put partisan
                  divisions aside and unite in a common cause, similar to the
                  national mobilization in the Great Depression and the Second
                  World War? We used a computational model to search for an
                  answer in the phase transitions of political polarization. The
                  model reveals asymmetric hysteresis trajectories with tipping
                  points that are hard to predict and that make polarization
                  extremely difficult to reverse once the level exceeds a
                  critical value.Research has documented increasing partisan
                  division and extremist positions that are more pronounced
                  among political elites than among voters. Attention has now
                  begun to focus on how polarization might be attenuated. We use
                  a general model of opinion change to see if the
                  self-reinforcing dynamics of influence and homophily may be
                  characterized by tipping points that make reversibility
                  problematic. The model applies to a legislative body or other
                  small, densely connected organization, but does not assume
                  country-specific institutional arrangements that would obscure
                  the identification of fundamental regularities in the phase
                  transitions. Agents in the model have initially random
                  locations in a multidimensional issue space consisting of
                  membership in one of two equal-sized parties and positions on
                  10 issues. Agents then update their issue positions by moving
                  closer to nearby neighbors and farther from those with whom
                  they disagree, depending on the agents{\textquoteright}
                  tolerance of disagreement and strength of party identification
                  compared to their ideological commitment to the issues. We
                  conducted computational experiments in which we manipulated
                  agents{\textquoteright} tolerance for disagreement and
                  strength of party identification. Importantly, we also
                  introduced exogenous shocks corresponding to events that
                  create a shared interest against a common threat (e.g., a
                  global pandemic). Phase diagrams of political polarization
                  reveal difficult-to-predict transitions that can be
                  irreversible due to asymmetric hysteresis trajectories. We
                  conclude that future empirical research needs to pay much
                  closer attention to the identification of tipping points and
                  the effectiveness of possible countermeasures.Simulated data

  abstract        = {Democracy often fails to meet its ideals, and these
                  failures may be made worse by electoral institutions. Unwanted
                  outcomes include elite polarization, unresponsive
                  representatives, and the ability of a faction of voters to
                  gain power at the expense of the majority. Various reforms
                  have been proposed to address these problems, but their
                  effectiveness is difficult to predict against a backdrop of
                  complex interactions. Here we outline a path for systems-level
                  modeling to help understand and optimize repairs to US
                  democracy. Following the tradition of engineering and biology,
                  models of systems include mechanisms with dynamical properties
                  that include nonlinearities and amplification (voting rules),
                  positive feedback mechanisms (single-party control,
                  gerrymandering), negative feedback (checks and balances),
                  integration over time (lifetime judicial appointments), and
                  low dimensionality (polarization). To illustrate a
                  systems-level approach, we analyze three emergent phenomena:
                  low dimensionality, elite polarization, and
                  antimajoritarianism in legislatures. In each case,
                  long-standing rules now contribute to undesirable outcomes as
                  a consequence of changes in the political environment.
                  Theoretical understanding at a general level will also help
                  evaluate whether a proposed reform{\textquoteright}s benefits
                  will materialize and be lasting, especially as conditions
                  change again. In this way, rigorous modeling may not only
                  shape new lines of research but aid in the design of effective
                  and lasting reform.There are no newly generated data

  abstract        = {In 1997, Robert Axelrod wondered in a highly influential
                  paper "If people tend to become more alike in their beliefs,
                  attitudes, and behavior when they interact, why do not all
                  such differences eventually disappear?" Axelrod&rsquo;s
                  question highlighted an ongoing quest for formal theoretical
                  answers joined by researchers from a wide range of
                  disciplines. Numerous models have been developed to understand
                  why and under what conditions diversity in beliefs, attitudes
                  and behavior can co-exist with the fact that very often in
                  interactions, social influence reduces differences between
                  people. Reviewing three prominent approaches, we discuss the
                  theoretical ingredients that researchers added to classic
                  models of social influence as well as their implications.
                  Then, we propose two main frontiers for future research.
                  First, there is urgent need for more theoretical work
                  comparing, relating and integrating alternative models.
                  Second, the field suffers from a strong imbalance between a
                  proliferation of theoretical studies and a dearth of empirical
                  work. More empirical work is needed testing and underpinning
                  micro-level assumptions about social influence as well as
                  macro-level predictions. In conclusion, we discuss major
                  roadblocks that need to be overcome to achieve progress on
                  each frontier. We also propose that a new generation of
                  empirically-based computational social influence models can
                  make unique contributions for understanding key societal
                  challenges, like the possible effects of social media on
                  societal polarization.},
